The volcano Maugna Whau (Mt. Eden) is one of about 50 volcanoes in the Auckland volcanic field. The data from the 'volcano' data set provides topographical information on a 10m x 10m grid for Maunga Whau. If somehow the top of this volcano was shaved off at 180 meters, it would have a nice meditation area. Or at least it looks like I actually did something slightly interesting with the code. :)  


```{r topo}
vTop <- volcano
vTop[vTop > 180] <- 180
topo <- plot_ly(z = ~vTop, type = "surface")
topo
```
